### Introduction

These documents describe provisioning a server and deploying the application to that server. Once your local machine
is setup with the proper tools and credentials, this all can be done with less than a handful of commands and in under 15
minutes (most of which is time waiting for the code to run).

1. [Requirements](requirements.md) - shows you how to set up your local machine for privisioning.
2. [Provisioning](provisioning.md) - shows you how to do a provisioning.
3. [Setup](setup.md) - shows you how to setup a provisioned server.
4. [Deploy](deploy.md) - shows you how to deploy the application.
